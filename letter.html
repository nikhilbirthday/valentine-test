      <strong>Dear Nikhil,</strong><br><br>

      I might not say this enough but I just want to let you know today, with this
      letter, how much you really mean to me.
      <br><br>

      <strong>1)</strong> You are the light to my darkest moments. These last few days have been
      exactly that… You saw me at my most emotional, most tired, and most
      chaotic phase and you loved me through all of it with patience, and
      calmness. You made me laugh when I didn’t even feel like smiling, and
      you made my heart and mind feel steady. You supported me through
      these tough days and even though we fought, we found our way back to
      each other right afterwards. <em>My soulmate.</em>
      <br><br>

      <strong>2)</strong> Yes, I overthink sometimes (a lot). But you are present in those vulnerable
      situations to help me sort through my thoughts. You back me up and
      support me when I’m under confident and you show me what I’m worth.
      <em>My calm.</em>
      <br><br>

      <strong>3)</strong> Even though I claim that I am an independent big girl, I still love it when
      you baby me. You order my cheat meals for me almost every week, you
      get me chocolates during my period, and you also help me with tech
      stuff (rarely because I’m so smart)! <em>My pillar.</em>
      <br><br>

      <strong>4)</strong> We’ve crossed miles, missed hugs and kisses, counted down days, and
      lived on video calls that somehow lasted for hours without ever feeling
      like enough. And yet, here we are! Still laughing, still loving and still
      choosing each other. <em>My constant.</em>
      <br><br>

      Today is Propose Day so I want to ask you something simple, but it comes
      from the deepest part of my heart…
      <br><br>

      <strong>
        Will you continue choosing me?<br>
        On days that are easy and days that are hard.<br>
        Across distances and across rooms.<br>
        In laughter, in silence, in love, and in life.
      </strong>
      <br><br>

      I don’t promise perfection, but I promise honesty, effort, loyalty, and a
      lifetime of loving you… Probably loudly on most days, quietly on others,
      but wholeheartedly <strong>ALWAYS</strong>.
      <br><br>

      <strong>I choose you. Yesterday. Today. Forever.</strong>
      <br><br>

      <span style="display:block; margin-top:20px;">
        ~ Love always,<br>
        <strong>Poorvi</strong> 💋💝
